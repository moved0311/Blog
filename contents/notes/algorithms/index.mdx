## Graph

### Dijkstra
```py
def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
	edges = defaultdict(list)
	for [s, d, w] in times:
		edges[s].append((d, w))

	visited = set()
	ans = 0
	minHeap = [(0, k)]

	while minHeap:
		(w1, n1) = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
		if n1 in visited:
			continue
		ans = max(ans, w1)
		visited.add(n1)

		for (n2, w2) in edges[n1]:
			if n2 not in visited:
				heapq.heappush(minHeap, (w1 + w2, n2))
	return ans if len(visited) == n else -1
